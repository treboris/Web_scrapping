QA Engineer for George (all genders)
Bratislava, Slovakia
Banking has a name. And we create it.
            With 9 million customers across Europe, George stands for a digital banking experience that combines design and technology on an open platform. At the George Labs, we strive for everyone. We achieve this by empowering people to understand, manage and, last but not least, enjoy one of their most personal things: their money. Join us in our agile environment and make banking simple, intelligent and personal again!
            We understand your pain. QA Engineers and Testers do not get the respect they deserve! But with us, your scripting knowledge and testing abilities is as much valued as the cool designs that come out of the creative team. You will work closely with our developers along the full user story, working together on the same code towards the same goal of providing market-ready software at the end of each Sprint. You will create well-structured and well-considered test cases, executing automation scripts using open source tools, all while keeping the nasty bugs away.
What you’ll bring with you
A toolkit full of software development and QA experience
Curiosity about object-oriented programming (Kotlin or Java preferred)
The ability to write clean and readable code with documentation
Experience with web and/or mobile testing (both manual and automated)
Hands-on experience with automated testing tools (e.g. Cypress, Appium) and deep insight of software QA methodologies
A natural confidence with your communication skills, while being fluent in English
Living the agile mindset, testing in a scrum team while collaborating with developers and business analysts
You will impress us by
Being able to independently solve problems and make decisions about testing results
Confidently wearing T-shirts with the slogan ‘TDD & BDD are not diseases!’
Being proactive and self-motivated without the ego to go with it
Having the ability to see the big picture and have a strong quality awareness
Knowing that variety, changing trends, and constantly upgrading your skills is better than any alternative
Why you will like us
We’re a team of experienced testers who love to exchange ideas and push the boundaries
We provide everything you need to work (e.g., MacBook Pro, mobile device, licenses) and lots of additional benefits
We are open minded, and always keen to stand up and go the extra mile for the correct solution
New Work is not just another buzz word to us. We proactively adapt to the ever-changing work environment of today
A competitive and performance-related salary dependent on your professional and personal qualifications is granted - we are obliged by law to quote the minimum wage of EUR 2.000,- gross per month for this full time position.
The way we are
           As an employee of Erste Digital, the success of our people is more than a motto, it’s our manifest. We nurture a work environment where age, skin colour, gender, sexual orientation and cultural background are seen as the key to our success – we live diversity!
If you’ve got this far
         It seems we have your interest. If you think you are a good fit for this position, please get in touch with us, we’d love to catch up.
