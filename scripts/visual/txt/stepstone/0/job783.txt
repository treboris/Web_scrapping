You are responsible for the solution design of connectivity products for vehicle and cloud applications with focus on easy usability for the MB.OS application developers and short time to market for new applications
You develop a cross-domain technology and sustainable solutions, that range from embedded systems (based on AUTOSAR) to cloud native systems (Kubernetes, IoT products of the respective cloud providers, ...)
You drive detailed analysis and you have a deep understanding of subsystems (embedded, network, cloud application, customer frontend) and provide the overall system requirements
You shape the connectivity product in the cloud with our international in-house development teams to build highly available services in the cloud
You coordinate the onboard, backend and frontend teams to ensure the best possible end-to-end experience to customers
You work in an agile development environment while continuously evaluate and improve engineering processes
