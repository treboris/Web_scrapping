Drive the development and architecture of robust and scalable data processing tools, processes and infrastructure at N26.
Work closely with data analysts, data scientists and other teams within the company to solve problems that require data.

What you need to be successful:

Experience with Kubernetes is a plus.
Ability to define new and challenge existing best practices for data processing and architecture.
Experience in mentoring other data engineers and knowledge sharing.
Ability to drive tech initiatives independently - from idea to implementation.
You search for pragmatic solutions to balance the different requirements of data projects, and build robust systems that create synergies instead of legacy.
