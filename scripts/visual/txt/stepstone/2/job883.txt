Ihre Rolle
Shape the digital future of ZEISS in the Global Algorithms & Software Semiconductor Mask Solutions team!
Your sophisticated algorithms evaluate enormous amounts of image data in a highly efficient manner. Only in this way do we as a team enable the performance of our complex photomask systems - the essential building block to manufacture defect-free microchips.
Our high-tech measurement systems for semiconductor lithography are characterized by extreme requirements on measurement performance and a high level of automated image evaluation. Robustly and efficiently evaluating complex customer requirements and large amounts of data with machine learning is very challenging. Your role is it to bring such solutions into our product.
You will develop highly accurate algorithms for image processing of Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) in expert teams. Your tasks will range from conceptual design and state of the art analysis over implementation and performance evaluation to product maturity. Here you can have significant influence on measurement data and product design to optimally acquire your input data.
You are continuously expanding your network within the company and our research partners.
Your innovation-driven mindset allows you to keep an eye on the latest technical developments and publications. You and your colleagues thus create the conditions for excellence.
