Frontend Angular Developer - Remote 
Would you like to join a funded startup (€1.2m) that develops an innovative data visualization platform?
Our client builds software that can detect anomalies on the production line (in a factory) where a camera screens the stuff on the line and the AI running behind it can detect product anomalies.
This platform can simulate data and model the manufacturing process to increase efficiencies.
Think of the AI, data visualization, visual detection...  This is as high-tech as it can get! Would you like to be a part of it?
This will be a great fit if you'd like to utilize your past few years of experience in web development and finally build THE BEST FRONTEND you could ever build... using the latest libraries, greatest CI/CD tools, and most advanced data visualization libraries.
