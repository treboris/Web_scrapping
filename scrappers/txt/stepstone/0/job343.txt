As a 100% subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group, we’re developing solutions for all of its brands, including Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche, and will bring our software to over 40 million vehicles by 2030.
Is this an easy task? Not at all! To tackle such a huge challenge, we need a great team. And that’s where you come in.

YOUR TEAM
We are developing the technical heart of the car, and this consists of the highly integrated computing platforms for different domains like Infotainment, Cockpit, Body, Connected Vehicle and more.
The Communication team is a specific unit within the Architecture and Development Department, responsible for all communication-relevant aspects such as ECU internal communication as well as communication from our computer towards the rest of the vehicle, typically via Ethernet or CAN-FD. Our responsibility spans from the selection of the needed Hardware, like Ethernet Switch or CAN-FD Transceiver, of low-level, hardware-based technologies such as Ethernet PHY or EMACs, throughout the specification, implementation and verification of all relevant system enablers for the communication over Ethernet and CAN-FD.&nbsp;
Moreover, our team is responsible for OS-level features such as IP-Stack and Firewall.
The service-oriented approach is the communication mechanism we use in our system and in the vehicle platform. It’s implementation in our devices includes service discovery as well as communication protocols such as SOME/IP and ViWi.
