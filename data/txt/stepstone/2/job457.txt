  System Architect Computational Imaging (d/f/m) 
Your responsibilities:
In this position, you will be responsible for driving our opto-digital transformation in optical microscopy systems and connecting optical and digital concepts. You will develop computational methods rooted in physical modeling of the imaging process, to shape the future of microscopic imaging and make advanced computational imaging methods accessible to life science researchers. This role is instrumental for advancing and transforming the core functionality of optical imaging in our microscopy systems for life science research. 
Concept development and feasibility studies, including:
Asking the right questions: Identifying digital solutions to imaging problems in life science research microscopy
Generating knowledge: Modeling the physics of the image formation process and developing and implementing forward and backward methods to identify sample characteristics from the recorded image data
Defining platforms: Devising future-proof platform architectures for computational imaging, in close interaction with the respective stakeholders
Making it all work: Deriving appropriate numerical procedures and hardware requirements to optical and computational hardware, demonstrating proof-of-principle in hardware and software, and supporting the implementation of production code and system development
  Development and management of in-house simulation tools, including:
Modeling, simulation, and solution of optical and physical problems in optical microscopy
Development and improvement of in-house simulation tools for technical and physical optics
  Management of development projects, including:
Technical project and platform management and interdisciplinary coordination of image data generation, data processing and respective instrument control
  Patent search and filing of inventions, including:
Monitoring of patent literature to ensure marketability and defendability of our computational imaging solutions
Generation of defendable intellectual property in the field of computational imaging, in cooperation with the patent department   
Your qualifications:
 Degree (PhD preferred) in experimental or theoretical physics, mathematics or a similar discipline and multiple years of specific work experience in a relevant role
Distinctive knowledge in mathematical methods for the description of physical relations, numerical optimization, and inverse methods.
Experience in analytical algorithm development and numerical implementation
Proficiency in scripting languages for fast prototyping (MATLAB, Python), ideally also in C++ and GPGPU programming (CUDA, OpenCL)
Ideally knowledge in digital image processing, control systems and theory.
Experience in technical project management, project and teamwork in interdisciplinary and intercultural teams, as well as technical direction of a team.
Knowledge of methods for problem analysis and solution, solution-oriented work ethics
Fluid knowledge of English and ideally German, social competences, communication skills, understanding of economic relations and dependencies 
What we offer:
Competitive salary and Bonus
Attractive compensation package (pension, healthcare and many more benefits)
Continuous training, support and focus on your personal development
Work in a global environment with cross-cultural teams
With us you get the chance to successfully contribute your own ideas
