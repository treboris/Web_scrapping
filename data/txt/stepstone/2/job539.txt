About the Role
Our Technology team isnâ€™t just one of the best in the industry, itâ€™s one of the best in the world. And weâ€™re proud of it. Itâ€™s our driving force; our engine.
From building a new banking backend to creating an award-winning app, thereâ€™s nothing (and we mean nothing) our tech team canâ€™t do.
Our Technology team isnâ€™t here to fix legacy systems â€“ itâ€™s here to build world-class financial products from the ground up.
Products that will be used by millions of people around the world.
You may expect our Python Engineers to work on heavily regulated banking systems, but we love the unexpected.
Weâ€™re actually better known internally for writing high-quality code and building complex novel solutions end-to-end.
These geniuses have created our chatbot â€“ the lovely Rita â€“ and they didnâ€™t stop there ðŸ¤¯
Theyâ€™ve also created automated FinCrime quality controls in a few weeks. Yes, theyâ€™re just that good!
Youâ€™ll never work alone, either. As a Python Engineer, youâ€™ll sit within a Product Team â€“ simultaneously working with Data Scientists, Analysts, Engineers, Product Owners and Operations Managers to solve problems and make our rocket ship fly even higher.
Ready to join?
What youâ€™ll be doing
Building APIs making sure they are properly designed and scale according to the business needs
Creating data pipelines to pull data from production services into our data warehouse - powering reporting, data analytics and data science
Writing event consumers to build new data models in order to provide this data to new flows and processes
What you'll need
5+ years of experience working as a Software Engineer
3+ years Engineering with Python as your primary language
An academic background in a STEM subject
Fluency in Python, SQL and other OOPLs
Experience with API development & integration
Practical understanding of distributed systems
Ability to write concurrent code in IO/CPU bound situations
Experience with Docker, K8s, Ansible, Teamcity, monitoring and alerting
Nice to have
