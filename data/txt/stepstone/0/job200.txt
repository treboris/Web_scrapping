50Hertz Transmission GmbH, Berlin
50Hertz is one of the four trans­mission system operators in Germany. We transport electricity at extra-high voltage level. The company's approximately 1,600 employees achieve something that until recently seemed impossible: advancing the energy transition at high speed while maintaining a high level of supply security. Together with the Belgian electricity grid operator Elia (Brussels), we form the inter­nationally active Elia Group.  The Product Owner APMO is leading the development of a groupwide asset management tool for both companies.
