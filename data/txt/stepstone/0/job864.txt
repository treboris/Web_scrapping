Our history in Germany dates back over 50 years. In that time, we have achieved a market-leader position, offering our customers not just full-service leasing, but sustainable and innovative mobility services, along with the technology that makes carefree mobility a reality. As a team, we live by our core values – focus on customer service, innovation, team spirit and responsibility.
Software Engineer (f/d/m)
Your role:

ALD’s digital unit works inward and outward to disrupt and transform both the organisation in how it works and our business models.

Our frontends are handcrafted with React. Infrastructure and Continuous Delivery are powered by Azure Pipelines, Kubernetes and GitOps (FluxCD). Our cloud providers are currently Azure and IBM Cloud Private (you know, compliance ...). To manage our work, we use “Portfolio Kanban” and improve continuously.
Challenges:
Design and implement state-of-the-art products using design concepts, methodologies and technologies that best suited to solve the challenge at hand.
Continuously improve yourself and your team in product quality and engineering productivity by designing flexible, secure and resilient solutions, writing easy-to-understand, maintainable and well-tested code.
Establish excellence on product delivery and quality within Hamburg and beyond.
Shape the mobility of tomorrow.
Who are we looking for?

You have worked with a variety of technologies and write clean, maintainable and well-tested code.
You know how it feels to work with lean/agile methodologies in a fast-paced environment.
You communicate effectively with various audiences in written and spoken English and German.

You keep an open mind and love to stay up to date on latest technologies.

You have worked with one of the well-known public cloud providers, like AWS, Azure, Google, IBM and have experience with containers and schedulers, such as Docker/gVisor, Kubernetes or serverless.
You automate and reduce waste wherever it makes sense.
You know how to own the path to production using Continuous Delivery/Continuous Integration.
Our offer:
Work in a collaborative, value-driven and multidisciplinary team to build best-in-class experiences for our customers.

Make a difference and be bold as a part of an ambitious and diverse team.
