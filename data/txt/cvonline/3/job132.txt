Your new company
The Air France KLM IT department mainly delivers applications and software for Air France KLM. Its population consists of about 2000 wonderful people from all ages located on different sites around the globe (incl India). We believe our engineers and data experts impact every day our companies financial and operational results, but they are also engaged in how we innovate and realize sustainable development in our industry.  Compared to the market, AFKL IT Development is mature in Agile implementation and a role model to many companies/airlines. We have ambition to grow further in our knowledge and skills and therefore need to safeguard the right balances in the sourcing of our internal and external contracted colleagues. Simultaneously we face the scarcity in talent pools within our Dutch border. KLM has 30.000 employees and is part of the bigger Air France KLM group. The group has a head office in Paris and Amsterdam and has several daughter companies. The AFKL group has over 550 aircraft and we are one of the bigger players in Europe.
